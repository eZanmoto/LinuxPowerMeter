    1.  INTRODUCTION

    Just a simple command-line tool to display the current battery level.

    To run:
        ./power_meter.py

    The power meter measures the voltage relative to the highest recorded
    voltage reading, so for best results run it at least once on a full charge.
    The reading displayed is simply the ratio of the remaining voltage relative
    to the highest recorded voltage.

    A command-line program for outputting the current battery state visually.
